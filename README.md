# Tun-d-in-A2
I have eight soundtracks that I created using Tunepad; all the links are listed below. When you click the link, a "welcome to Tunepad" prompt will appear; click "ok" to continue. 
Next, go to the top left of the page and click the "play all" button to hear the soundtrack. 


Angry = https://tunepad.com/project/113143 
Angry Studymode = https://tunepad.com/project/115869

Happy = https://tunepad.com/project/113139
Happy Studymode = https://tunepad.com/project/115868

Calm = https://tunepad.com/project/113142
Calm Studymode = https://tunepad.com/project/115871

Sad = https://tunepad.com/project/113144
Sad Studymode = https://tunepad.com/project/115870 

These soundtracks were then imported into p5.js and are played when prompted in my interactive browser-friendly project, Tun'd In. 

The link to my project https://editor.p5js.org/sophia1234999/sketches/GoTfQwII3 

When you click on the link, you are greeted with my code behind the project. To see the final product, click (with the mouse) the red play button in the top left corner, and it will appear on the right-hand side. 

Click on the coloured square desired, either "Happy, Angry, Sad or Calm,  and the corresponding sound will automatically begin to play. 

To enable "studymode", scroll down and you'll see a button in the bottom centre of the project writing "regular mode"
Click it to change between study mode and regular. 

NOTE YOU CAN NOT CLICK ON MULTIPLE SOUNDS AT ONCE OR THEY WILL REMIX. 
If this occurs, click the red play button to reset the page.
