I have 8 soundtracks which I created on Tunepad, all the links are placed underneath. When you click the link a "welcome to Tunepad" prompt will appear, click "ok" to continue. 
Next go to the top left of the page and click the "play all" button to hear the soundtrack.

When you click on the link you are greeted with my code behind the project. To see the final product click the red play button in the top left corner, it will appear on the right hand side. 

To enable "studymode" scroll down and you'll see a button in the bottom centre of the project writing "regular mode"
Click it change between study mode and regular. 

NOTE YOU CAN NOT CLICK ON MULTIPLE SOUNDS AT ONCE OR THEY WILL REMIX.
